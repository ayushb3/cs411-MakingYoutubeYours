## Project Summary

For this project, we developed an application that can display intuitive data distribution and keyword recommendations to educators. Let educators know more about the audience and their viewing preferences and habits, so as to make better video creation and get inspiration for creating relevant new content. Also let their videos get more exposure.

Our application will provide a comprehensive analysis of popular video titles, tags and keywords, and recommend to video creators the tags that similar videos usually add and possible video categories through the description entered by the video creator. This allows educators to choose titles and hashtags that are likely to attract a larger audience. In this project, we also have a visualization of trending videos, giving users a visual representation of how their content is performing compared to other videos in their category and desired audience demographics. By analyzing when the website has the most traffic and the audience, video exposure can be realized when the user traffic is the most. Trend tracking and relevance analysis capabilities allow educators to understand how some of the hottest topics of the moment influence their audience's interests, helping them create more relevant content. The application in our project also supports a video recommendation system, helping users discover new content they may be interested in and increasing their interaction with the application.
